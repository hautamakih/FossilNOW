## Questions?

- How is this clustering done?
  - This was answered in the paper
- What are the x and y axes of the line charts?
- What are the column names of the file `res_all_Cervidae.csv` in the dir `4_outputs3`

## Plan

- Two groups
-   one focusing on the recommender system
-   one focusing on the visualizations
